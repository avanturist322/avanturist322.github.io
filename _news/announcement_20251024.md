I would like to thank my colleagues for presenting at [Fall into ML 2025](https://cs.hse.ru/ml2025) the papers [Recurrent Action Transformer with Memory](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.09459) and [Memory, Benchark & ​​Robots: A Benchmark for Solving Complex Tasks with RL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10550), which were accepted to NeurIPS-2025, including an oral presentation on the second paper.

See [posters](https://cs.hse.ru/ml2025/poster_session?_r=7715861760084378.33407) page for details.
