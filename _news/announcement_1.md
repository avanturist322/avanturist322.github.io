From September 27 to September 30, 2025, I will be participating in the [CoRL-2025](https://www.corl.org/) conference. Three papers will be presented at the [RemembeRL](https://rememberl-corl25.github.io/) workshop:
1. ELMUR: External Layer Memory with Update/Rewrite for Long-Horizon RL (spotlight)
2. Memory, Benchmark & Robots: A Benchmark for Solving Complex Tasks with Reinforcement Learning (poster)
3. Unraveling the Complexity of Memory in RL Agents: an Approach for Classification and Evaluation (poster)
